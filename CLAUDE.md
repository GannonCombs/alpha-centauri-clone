You are helping me design and develop a video game clone of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, to practice my game dev skills.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Framework**: Pygame 2.6.1
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented with separate modules for game logic, rendering, UI, and AI

## Development Approach
- Start with simple mechanics and iterate
- Use classic game development patterns (game loop, state management, event handling)
- Implement AI using 1990s-style rule-based logic (no modern ML)
- Focus on gameplay fundamentals before advanced features
- Before implementing any game mechanic, read the relevant section of game/notes/datalinks.md.

## Project Context
The file \@general_index.md contains a comprehensive index of all files in the codebase with detailed descriptions of their functionality and responsibilities.
