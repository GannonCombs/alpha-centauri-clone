TODO: List every tech out here. Put a check by it if it is fully complete. Put a yield sign by it if the tech was
analyzed and considered to be waiting on a feature. Example: Centauri Meditation increases energy from fungus, but we
haven't created fungus yet.

Format: ✓ = Fully implemented, ◐ = Partially implemented, 👤 = Human signed off, ⚠ = Waiting on feature, blank = Not implemented
