TODO: List every base facility out here. Put a check by it if it is fully complete. Put a yield sign by it if the tech was
analyzed and considered to be waiting on a feature. Example: Genejack Factory increases drones, but we haven't implemented
drones yet.

Format: ✓ = Fully implemented, ◐ = Partially implemented, 👤 = Human signed off, ⚠ = Waiting on feature, blank = Not implemented
