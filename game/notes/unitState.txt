There are a number of unit states in the game. Each of these is associated with a hotkey which shows above the unit.
These include:
H - hold unit
L - board unit (onto transport)
G - move unit
J - move units as a group
P - patrol

As well as terraformer-specific states:
M - build mine
R - build road/magtube
etc.



| 1. Press H → unit shows 'H' indicator, leaves cycle                                                     │
│ 2. Clicking on the unit selects it, thus unholding it. Unit re-enters cycle
| 2b (Therefore, pressing H again is not possible.)                                                      │
│ 4. Press L to board transport → no 'H' shown on unit; unit removed from cycle                           │
│ 5. Transport adjacent to land → boarded unit appears in cycle, selectable                               │
│ 6. Transport far from land → boarded unit not in cycle                                                  │
│ 7. Disembark → unit has N-1 moves (not 0), can still move/act                                           │
│ 8. Click any busy unit → shows confirmation dialog (not just formers)                                   │
│ 9. Save and load → status persists correctly; no held key errors


Steps involved in holding a unit:


1. main.py listens to h among its key presses: elif event.key == pygame.K_h:
 - Units can have "held" state. Pressing h toggles it. Edit: can you toggle it?
 - Attempt to pass this on the game.py (good) through set_status_message (prob bad), cycle_units (good), and selected_unit (?)
2. game.py

Steps involved in cycling through units, and skipping those on hold:
