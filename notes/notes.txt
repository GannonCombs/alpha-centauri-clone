Things I "added" but haven't tested to ensure correctness.

First, the meta-issue. I created a debug mode to be able to test anything.
Use it to test the following issues, but also test debug mode along the way.

✅

 2. Energy Allocation System
  - Split energy production between Economy, Labs, and Psych
  - Economy → Energy reserves (treasury)
  - Labs → Research speed
  - Psych → Talent creation (happiness)
  - Adjustable slider/percentage allocation

  3. Psych, Drones, and Talents System
  - Drones = unhappy citizens (appear based on difficulty and base size)
  - Talents = happy citizens (created via Psych allocation or facilities)
  - Drone Riots occur when Drones > Talents (production stops)
  - Facilities like Recreation Commons reduce drones
  - Police units can suppress drones (based on POLICE social engineering)

    5. Unit Support & Maintenance
  - Units cost minerals to support (based on SUPPORT social engineering)
  - Free support levels (2 units per base by default)
  - Exceeding support level drains minerals from production
  - "Clean Reactor" ability eliminates support costs

  9. Air Units & Fuel/Range
  - Air units have limited range (must return to base/airbase)
  - Range measured in turns from base
  - Needlejets: 2 turn range, Copters: 1 turn range
  - Airbases allow refueling
  - Air superiority combat (+100% vs. air, -50% vs. ground)

     Feature 12: Special Unit Abilities

  - Clean Reactor: No support cost
  - AAA Tracking: +100% vs air units
  - Comm Jammer: +50% attack
  - Blink Displacer: Ignores base defense
  - Empath Song: +50% vs psi armor
  - Framework ready for Cloaking, Drop Pods, Amphibious Pods, Fungal Payload


    13. Probe Teams
  - Infiltrate datalinks
  - Steal technology
  - Sabotage facilities
  - Incite drone riots
  - Mind control units/bases
  - Success rate based on PROBE social engineering

     Feature 14: Sea Transport & Loading

  - Sea units can carry up to 4 land units
  - Loaded units move with transport automatically
  - Unload to adjacent land tiles
  - Loaded units destroyed if transport is destroyed


    Feature 15: Disengage Mechanic

  - Fast units can escape when damaged to 50% or less HP
  - Requires 2+ movement advantage over opponent
  - Success chance: 50% base + morale bonuses + speed bonuses
  - Units retreat to safe adjacent tiles

   Feature 24: Base Conquest (Disloyal Citizens)                                                              ─

  - Captured bases have disloyal citizens for 50 turns
  - Formula: 5 - (turns_since_capture // 10), capped by base size
  - Extra drones make conquered bases harder to manage
  - Works with both combat conquest and probe mind control


   Feature 25: Planetary Council Proposals

  - Added 5 proposals: Unity Core, Global Trade Pact, Solar Shade, Melt Polar Caps, Atrocity Prohibitions
  - Voting UI fully functional
  - Effects implemented (some stubbed for future work)

   Feature 26: Victory Conditions

  - Conquest: Eliminate all enemies
  - Diplomatic: 20 turns as Supreme Leader
  - Economic: 50k credits + Economic Victory project
  - Transcendence: Complete Ascent to Transcendence

  Feature x: Artillery
  - Right click
  - Some hot key also activates


Notes:
(several of these are POSSIBLY fixed)
1 The amount of time units/facilities take to produce is hardcoded. Need to make dynamic. Check game files for details.
2 Once we get the commlink of every living faction, give a popup that we now have them all, and thus can now call council.
3 If another unit gets all contacts first, they may call council. Add to the AI behavior that encourages them to call things
that they like. Examples: remove atrocity prohibitions if their faction is warlike, elect governor if they are a candidate, etc.
4 In the tech screen, there is a little text box inside the tech that is colored the correct category of the tech (it's 4x color).
This is great. However, the outline for the tech box itself is always yellow. It should be the same 4x color.
5 There's something odd where the 7 starting techs are all white in the tech view, but we don't have access to their perks.
We should NOT be starting with the 7 starting techs. Each 1 is the starting tech for a particular faction. Check game files for details.
6 Whenever there is a new technology that improves a unit, the game should automatically make some stored designs.
For example, in the latest playthrough, I discovered Industrial Base, giving Synthmetal Armor. The game should know to make a new
1-2-1 unit.
7 Hold unit isn't working. Still in W cycle, and End Turn still doesn't activate correctly after.
